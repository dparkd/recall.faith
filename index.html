    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Recall the last time you spent time with the Lord.</p>
    <p>It's great to start the day personally with the Lord. It used to be easy, but we are being distracted.</p>
    <p>Phones entered our lives, we are quicker than ever, things are more accessible, and we are in general more distracted.</p>
    <p>/</p>
    <p>Recall the last time your co-worker, friend, or family talked about your faith.</p>
    <p>The demonstration of our faith used to be through our actions and lifestyles.</p>
    <p>But things got too hectic, everything became normalized and we are missing on chances.</p>
    <p>/</p>
    <p>Good news, we want the Good News to be prevelant in our lives daily. We want to <i>recall</i>.</p>
    <p><i>recall.faith</i> is a start of a moment that aims to help brothers and sisters recall their faith in the menial. We are not a movement. We want to help strike moments in your lives.</p>
    <p>From physical and digital experiences that help you remember the goodness of God to products that equip you to share the gospel in a new and refreshing way - Recall wants you to <i>recall.</i> </p>
    <p>/</p>
    <p>Invites to alpha experiences and products are going out soon. To get on the list, email us or phone us. Real people, not machines.</p>
